Linear Regression program


This is a linear regression model built without using any machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.  
However, it might not be efficient and cannot be used for other regression problems.  
I found joy in implementing the concepts I learned from my math lecturer in the Statistical Methods class, which inspired me to do this.  
For the rest of the operations, I used other libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, etc. ðŸ˜…


Letâ€™s explore the math behind machine learning. ðŸ“ˆ
